defmodule AshDecisions.Resources.Base do
  @moduledoc """
  Resolves what the resource macros should `use`.

  By default each generated resource is `use Ash.Resource` with the Postgres data
  layer and the policy authorizer — a self-contained resource that needs no host
  scaffolding. That is the right default for a library, and it is the wrong one
  for an application that has a **base resource**: a module every resource in the
  application goes through so that ownership, provenance, audit, soft delete,
  tenancy and the policy set arrive by inheritance rather than by remembering.

  A decision definition and the record of what it decided are exactly the kind of
  rows such an application wants inside that net. "Which version of which rule
  decided this case, in which tenant, on whose behalf, and can I still see it a
  year later" is a question the host has already answered once for every other
  record it owns, and a decision engine that answers it a second way answers it
  differently.

  So each macro takes `:base`:

      defmodule MyApp.Decisions.Definition do
        use AshDecisions.Resources.Definition,
          domain: MyApp.Decisions,
          repo: MyApp.Repo,
          base: MyApp.Platform.Resource,
          base_opts: [ownership: :organization_owned]
      end

  `:base_opts` is passed to the base module's `__using__/1` verbatim, with
  `:domain` filled in. Nothing else is assumed about it — this package does not
  know what options your base resource takes.

  ## What the macro stops emitting

  With `:base` set, the macro no longer emits `data_layer:` or `authorizers:`.
  Those are the base's decision, and passing them here would either duplicate or
  silently override it.

  It also stops emitting the `multitenancy` block and the `organization_id`
  attribute, because a base resource that is worth having already owns tenancy —
  emitting a second strategy would conflict with the first. Combining `:base`
  with `tenant?: true` therefore raises at compile time rather than producing a
  resource with two opinions about which column scopes it; put the option in
  `:base_opts` instead, where the base can act on it.
  """

  @doc """
  Returns the AST for the `use` call at the top of a generated resource.

  Raises `ArgumentError` when `:base` is combined with `tenant?: true` — see the
  moduledoc for why those two cannot both be honoured.

          A base resource owns multitenancy for every resource that goes through

          give the resource two strategies. Pass the option to the base instead:
